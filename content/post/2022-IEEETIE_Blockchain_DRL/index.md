Our paper "A blockchain-enabled demand management and control framework driven by deep reinforcement learning" is accepted by IEEE Trans. Industrial Electronics. This paper presents a framework leveraging Internet-of-Things and AI to manage and massive amount of distributed controllable resources. This framework is implemented in a consortium open-source blockchain platform, Hyperledger Fabric, and verified with real-world data. We are also working on a pilot project demonstrating this work in real-world power systems.
