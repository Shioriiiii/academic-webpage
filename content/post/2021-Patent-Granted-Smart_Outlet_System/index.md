In this invention, systems and methods are disclosed to control the power grid frequency by capturing the frequency change using an extended Kalman filter method with the distributed smart outlet devices at the low-voltage distribution level; and locally control the relay that provides power to the appliance by comparing the captured frequency with the threshold sent from the cloud control center.
