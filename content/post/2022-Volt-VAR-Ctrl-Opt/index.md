Our software which optimizes and controls the voltage and reactive power of distribution grids has been successfully implemented at 5 dispatcher centers, which controls multiple renewable power plants. The software has been tested in closed-loop operation for 5 days, demonstrating its advantages over classical solutions in this area.
