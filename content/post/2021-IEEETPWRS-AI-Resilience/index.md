Our paper "A Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Multi-agent Framework to Enhance Power System Resilience Using Shunt Resources" is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Power Systems. In this paper, a data driven multi-agent framework based on a deep-reinforcement learning is proposed to overcome the computation and scalability concerns related to precise system models and to plan for the deployment of shunts for power system resilience enhancement
