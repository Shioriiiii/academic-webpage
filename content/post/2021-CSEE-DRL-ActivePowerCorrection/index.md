Our two-part paper "Active Power Correction Strategies based on Deep Reinforcement Learning, Part I: A distributed solution for adaptability, Part II: A simulation-driven solution for robustness" is accepted by CSEE Journal of Power and Energy Systems. This is joint work of my team and a research team from Wuhan University, resulted from our participation in the power system AI competition L2RPN NeurIPS (both tracks) 2020.
