Paper "Data-Driven Joint Voltage Stability Assessment Considering Load Uncertainty: A Variational Bayes Inference Integrated with Multi-CNNs" is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Power Systems. This paper proposes approach to combine multiple convolutional neural networks (multi-CNNs) to assess the transient and steady-state voltage stability of power systems.
