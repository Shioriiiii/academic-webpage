Our vision of the future is that power system will eventually be inextricably intertwined with the Internet of Things (IoT). With this belief we created and developed a complete set of hardware and software solution from scratch, the Grid Sense, that can perform automatic direct load control based on system frequency along with coordination from the cloud. Grid Sense utilizes the state-of-the-art IoT and edge computing technologies.

In May 2018, NARI Group decided to acquire our Grid Sense solution. Based on this deal, GEIRINA will get 10% of the total product sales from NARI Group for the next 10 years!!
