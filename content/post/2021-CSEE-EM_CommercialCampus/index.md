"Risk-constrained Energy Management Strategy for a Commercial Campus Considering Comprehensive Reserves Against Islanding Conditions" has been accepted by CSEE Journal of Power and Energy Systems. This paper proposes an optimal risk-constrained energy management strategy for commercial buildings in a commercial campus with islanding capabilities. A two-stage risk-constrained, scenario-based stochastic optimization approach is adopted to handle various uncertainties associated with the energy management process, such as power generation of roof-top solar panels, arrival stateof-charges, and arrival/departure time of plug-in electric vehicles, intermittent load demand, and uncertain grid-connection conditions.
