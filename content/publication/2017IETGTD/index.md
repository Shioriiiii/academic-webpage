abstract = "This study proposes an online measurement-based method for n -1 voltage stability assessment on a load area by means of an equivalent system of N + 1 buses introduced by Hu et al . to represent N boundary buses of the load area and the external system. This method utilises real-time synchro-phasor measurements on N boundary buses and online state estimation on the load area to analyse n -1 sensitivities for equivalent transfer admittances and power flows by means of a modified line outage distribution factor in order to estimate the voltage stability margin of power transfer to each boundary bus under an anticipated n -1 condition. The method is demonstrated on the Northeast Power Coordinating Council 48-machine, 140-bus power system."
