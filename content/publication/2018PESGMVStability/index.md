abstract = "This paper proposes an approach to address the voltage stability assessment (VSA) considering N-1 contingency. The approach leverages the sensitivity based Thevenin index (STI) which involves evaluating the Jacobian matrix at current operating condition. Since the N-1 contingency case is hypothetical, there is no information regarding the operating condition after a foreseen contingency. The proposed approach first estimates the post-contingency operating point as well as possible PV-PQ transitions based on the current operating point. Then the STI for each contingency can be predicted using the estimated operating condition. Numerical results based on IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach in predicting the voltage stability margin under contingency. Moreover, the on-line implementation of the proposed approach is promising since it only involves solving several linear equations."
