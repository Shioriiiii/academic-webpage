abstract = "An optimal placement problem on Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) integrating the optimization on BESS controller parameters is formulated for power system oscillation damping improvement in this paper. First, a BESS model is established based on the power output characteristics of its power converter interface considering the converter power limit, State of Charge (SOC) limit, and the time constant of converters. Then the objective function and constraints are introduced to establish a black-box mixed-integer optimization problem tackled by interfacing time-domain simulations with a Mixed-Integer Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Finally, the proposed optimization procedure is tested on the New England 39-bus system and the Nordic test system. The optimal results are also verified by time-domain simulations. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method is investigated including: consideration of seasonal load change; minimum number of BESS units to be placed; improvement of the PSO efficiency and performance comparison of different controllers. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for optimization of the battery energy storage placement."
